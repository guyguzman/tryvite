this project contains a file named ai_bookmarks.json. The type field indicates whether it is a folder or a url. The name field is the name of the folder or the url. The url field is the url. It is a list of bookmarks with the corresponding urls. Some of the entries in the json file contain children. The types of entries are called foldlers. These folders contain more bookmarks. Create a list of bookmarks in a minimalist format with multiple columns on a desktop computer. The folders should be listed first and should have expand/collapse buttons and the folder names should be in a bold font. The urls that are not in folders should be listed below the list of folders. All of the folders and the urls shold be in alphabetical format using the name field. The folders should be listed first though.
